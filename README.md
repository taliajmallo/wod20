This system is for playing Exalted versus World of Darkness in the Foundry Virtual Tabletop system. It has been forked from the [V20 system], and will retain functionality and assets from that system as a result. Future efforts may add functionality from other World of Darkness 20th Anniversary edition rulebooks.

Licensed materials will NOT be provided as this is a system provided for public use for free.
